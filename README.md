# SafeAlignment-Explicit-Safety-Signal
Official implementation for "Safety Alignment Can Be Not Superficial With Explicit Safety Signals"

Hi everyone,

Due to the NeurIPS deadline (May 22nd) and the start of my internship, I wasnâ€™t able to organize and release the code by the camera-ready submission deadline. I will make sure the code is released by the start of the conference.
