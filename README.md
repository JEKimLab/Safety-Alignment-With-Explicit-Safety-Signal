# Safety-Alignment-Explicit-Safety-Signal
Official implementation for "Safety Alignment Can Be Not Superficial With Explicit Safety Signals"

Hi everyone,

Due to the NeurIPS deadline (May 22nd) and the start of my internship (May 19th), I wasnâ€™t able to organize and release the code by the camera-ready submission deadline (May 29th). I will make sure the code is released by the start of the conference.
